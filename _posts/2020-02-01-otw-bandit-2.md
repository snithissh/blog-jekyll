Welcome back to the walkthrough of the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire. If you haven't checked out [Part 1](link-to-part-1) covering levels 0-13, make sure to do that first. Let's dive into the remaining levels!

## Level 14 → Level 15

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost:

```bash
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
Correct!
BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
```

The `nc` (netcat) command is used for TCP and UDP connections. The password is `BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr`.

## Level 15 → Level 16

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption:

```bash
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
...
BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
Correct!
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
```

The `openssl s_client` command is used for SSL/TLS connections. The password is `cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd`.

## Level 16 → Level 17

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port in the range 31000 to 32000. First, find the open ports:

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
...
31790/tcp open  unknown
...
```

Then, connect to the open port using SSL and submit the current password:

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
...
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
Correct!
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvmOkuifmMg6HL2YPIOjon6iWfbp7c3jx34YkYWqUH57SUdyJ
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The server returns a private SSH key. Save this to a file and use it to log in as `bandit17`:

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/myname123
bandit16@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/myname123
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ vim sshkey.private
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ chmod 600 sshkey.private
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit17@localhost
```

Remember to set the permissions of the private key file to 600 (read-write only for owner).

## Level 17 → Level 18

There are two files in the home directory: `passwords.new` and `passwords.old`. The password for the next level is in `passwords.new` and is the only line that has been changed between `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`:

```bash  
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new
42c42
< hlbSBPAWJmL6WFDb06gpTx1pPButblOA
---
> kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
```

The `diff` command shows the lines that differ between two files. The password is `kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd`.

## Level 18 → Level 19

The password for the next level is stored in a file `readme` in the home directory. However, someone has modified `.bashrc` to log you out when you log in with SSH:

```bash
$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
...
Byebye !
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.
```

To bypass this, we can execute a command directly using SSH:

```bash
$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
```

The password is `IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x`.

## Level 19 → Level 20

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the home directory. Run it without arguments to find out how to use it:

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

Now, run the `id` command as `bandit20` to confirm that the setuid binary works, then cat the `bandit20` password file:

```bash  
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j  
```

The password is `GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j`.

## Level 20 → Level 21

There is a setuid binary in the home directory that does the following: 
- Connects to localhost on the port you specify as a command line argument. 
- Reads a line of text from the connection using `recv()`.
- If the password matches, sends back the password for the next level using `send()`.

To get the next password:

1. In one terminal, start a netcat listener on an arbitrary port (e.g., 12345) and input the current level's password when connected to:
   ```bash
   bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -lvp 12345
   listening on [any] 12345 ...
   GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
   ```

2. In another terminal, run the setuid binary with the chosen port as argument:
   ```bash
   bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 12345
   Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
   Password matches, sending next password
   ```

3. The first terminal should receive the password for the next level:
   ```bash
   bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -lvp 12345
   listening on [any] 12345 ...
   GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
   gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
   ```

The password is `gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr`.

## Level 21 → Level 22

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in `/etc/cron.d/` for the configuration and see what command is being executed:

```bash
bandit21@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls
cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

The script is periodically writing the password to the `/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv` file. Read that file to get the password:

```bash
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI  
```

The password is `Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI`.

## Level 22 → Level 23

A shell script is executed periodically. Inspect the script:

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

The script is doing the following:

1. Storing the current username in the `$myname` variable.
2. Generating an MD5 hash of the string "I am user $myname", cutting out the first field of the output (the hash itself), and storing it in the `$mytarget` variable.
3. Copying the password file for the current user to `/tmp/$mytarget`.

To get the password, simply execute the same commands with `bandit23` as `$myname`:

```bash
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ myname=bandit23
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
```

The password is `jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n`.

## Level 23 → Level 24

Another shell script is executed periodically:

```bash
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Executing $i"
        timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

The script runs all the scripts in the `/var/spool/bandit24` directory as `bandit24`, then deletes them. To get the password:

1. Create a script that cats the `bandit24` password file and saves it in the `/tmp` directory (which is world-writable):
   ```bash
   bandit23@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/myname123
   bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/myname123
   bandit23@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ vim getpass.sh
   ```

   Script contents:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/myname123/bandit24_password
   ```

2. Make the script executable and copy it to the `/var/spool/bandit24` directory:
   ```bash
   bandit23@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ chmod 777 getpass.sh
   bandit23@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ cp getpass.sh /var/spool/bandit24/
   ```

3. Wait for the cronjob to run (should be almost instant), then retrieve the password from the `/tmp/myname123/bandit24_password` file:
   ```bash
   bandit23@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ cat bandit24_password
   UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
   ```

The password is `UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ`.

## Level 24 → Level 25

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinatiions, called brute-forcing:

```bash
bandit24@bandit:~$ for i in {0000..9999}; do echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i; done | nc localhost 30002 | grep -v Wrong
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG

Exiting.
```

The `for` loop goes through all numbers from 0000 to 9999. These are combined with the bandit24 password and sent to the daemon using netcat. The `grep -v Wrong` filters out the failed attempts.

The password is `uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG`.

## Level 25 → Level 26

Logging in as `bandit25`, we find a shell script:

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ ls
bandit26.sshkey
```

But there's no password file. Instead, there's an SSH private key, which can be used to log into `bandit26`:

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
...
Connection to localhost closed.
```

However, it immediately closes the connection. Looking at `/etc/passwd`, we see why:

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```

Instead of the usual `/bin/bash`, the shell for `bandit26` is set to `/usr/bin/showtext`. Let's see what that does:

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

It sets the terminal type to `linux`, then displays the contents of `~/text.txt` using `more`, and exits. The `more` command is key here - it allows us to view the file one screen at a time. If the file content is longer than the terminal height, `more` will allow you to scroll down... and execute commands!

To exploit this, resize your terminal window to have a very small height before running the `ssh` command. This will force `more` to pause at the bottom of the `text.txt` file. Then, press `v` to open Vim, and you'll be able to run commands as `bandit26`!

In Vim, we can execute a shell using `:shell`, and then retrieve the password:

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z
```

The password is `5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z`.

## Level 26 → Level 27

From the previous level, we're already logged in as `bandit26`. The `text.txt` file in the home directory hints at setting the `$SHELL` variable:

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
text.txt
bandit26@bandit:~$ cat text.txt
  _                     _ _ _   ___   __  
 | |                   | (_) | |__ \ / /  
 | |__   __ _ _ __   __| |_| |_   ) / /_  
 | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __| / / '_ \

This time, there's no obvious commit adding the password. But remember, git stores all versions of a project. Let's look at the whole history using `git log -p`:

```bash
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/myname123/repo$ git log -p

We see a commit that changes `bandit28` to `bandit29` in the username. Let's look further back:

Aha! This commit changed the password from `xxxxxxxxxx` to `0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2`. That's the password we're looking for.

## Level 29 → Level 30

Another git repo:

```bash
bandit29@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r----- 1 bandit30 bandit29 33 May  7 20:14 README.md
bandit29@bandit:~$ cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for bandit30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: <no passwords in production!>
```

Clone it and look at the branches:

```bash
bandit29@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/myname123
bandit29@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/myname123
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo
...
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ cd repo
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/myname123/repo$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```

There's a `dev` branch. Let's check it out and look at the differences:

```bash
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/myname123/repo$ git checkout dev
Branch dev set up to track remote branch dev from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'dev'

## Level 30 → Level 31

There's another git repo:

```bash
bandit30@bandit:~$ ls
repo
bandit30@bandit:~$ cd repo/
bandit30@bandit:~/repo$ ls
README.md
bandit30@bandit:~/repo$ cat README.md 
just an epmty file... muahaha
```

The `README.md` file doesn't contain the password. Let's check the branches:

```bash
bandit30@bandit:~/repo$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
```

Only the `master` branch. What about tags?

```bash
bandit30@bandit:~/repo$ git tag
secret
bandit30@bandit:~/repo$ git show secret
47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5
```

Aha! The tag named `secret` contains the password: `47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5`.

## Level 31 → Level 32

Yet another git repo:

```bash
bandit31@bandit:~$ ls
repo
bandit31@bandit:~$ cd repo/
bandit31@bandit:~/repo$ ls
README.md
bandit31@bandit:~/repo$ cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```

We need to add a file named `key.txt` with the content 'May I come in?', commit it, and push to the `master` branch:

```bash
bandit31@bandit:~/repo$ echo 'May I come in?' > key.txt
bandit31@bandit:~/repo$ git add key.txt
bandit31@bandit:~/repo$ git commit -m 'add key.txt'
[master f17132a] add key.txt

```

The push is rejected by the remote, but it prints the password for the next level: `56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e`.

## Level 32 → Level 33

After logging in, we're presented with an uppercase shell (UPPERCASE SHELL). Everything we type is converted to uppercase:

```bash
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> ls
sh: 1: LS: not found
>> $0
$ ls
uppershell
$ whoami
bandit33
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee
```

To break out of the uppercase shell, we can simply execute `$0`, which refers to the current shell (in this case, `/bin/sh`). Then we can run commands normally and retrieve the password: `c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee`.

## Level 33 → Level 34

At this point, there are no more levels. We've completed the Bandit wargame!

```bash
bandit33@bandit:~$ ls
README.txt
bandit33@bandit:~$ cat README.txt 
Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working
on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!
```

---

And with that, we've completed the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire! I hope this walkthrough has been helpful in understanding the concepts and techniques used in each level.

Remember, the Bandit wargame is designed to teach the basics. The real fun begins when you apply these skills to real-world scenarios and other, more complex wargames. Keep practicing, keep learning, and most importantly, keep hacking!

Until next time, happy hacking!
