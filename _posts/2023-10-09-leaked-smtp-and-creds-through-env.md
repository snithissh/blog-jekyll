## Introduction

Let me share with you the background of this bug bounty program. This bug bounty program is hosted independently and is built around the concept of offering self-driving cars as a service, along with providing marketing and digital solutions for drivers. While conducting reconnaissance on our target, we stumbled upon a subdomain. During our content discovery process on this subdomain, we encountered a 403 error when attempting to access the .env file. However, it’s worth noting that there are certain restrictions in place when directly accessing their `CNAME record`, for instance, which is hosted on Azure and appears as `*.azurewebsites.com`. Interestingly, there are no such restrictions in place, allowing us to successfully access the `.env` file.

## Exploiting this Vulnerability

After recon, Found a subdomain where it is backend framework is meant to be laravel. Once after finding the subdomain, I have started doing content discovery on to the subdomain and found that .env file got disclosed through ffuf

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/leaked-creds-1.png)

Now when we are opening our .env path in our browser and well it shows that we got a forbidden status

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/leaked-creds-2.png)

Then how we exploited this issue, while there might be restrictions at the domain level like lets assume they might have placed restrictions at the ***.example.com**. But what about the CNAMEs or what about the hosting services like AWS or Azure. If you read my first blog, where the customer data got disclosed through a server which is hosted on EC2 instances. Same applies here, where check the cname record they have provided something like **exampleapp.azurewebsites.net**

```sh
root@DESKTOP-4SC48HP:/mnt/c/Users/nithi# dig example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.2-Ubuntu <<>> example.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

```

Now when you visit the exampleapp.azurewebsites.net on the browser and It does had the same response as same as the main website just like a mirrored site and opening the .env file suprisingly it didn’t had a restriction and we can able to view all the environment variables

## Conclusion

We can also go further about the exploiting both the database and SMTP with those credentials but this program has certain limitations in order to make the proof of concept. In this situation, Where I had discussion with the program manager and they have informed that it is valid finding and Informed that don’t escalate further

Thanks for reading my writeup and I hope you have learnt something new.
